# Entry 6
##### 6/2/20

### Update
A lot has happened after my previous blog entry. I was successful in gathering the data necessary to train my bot through a python script that continuously runs the game. After that I tried something fun which is to visualize the results of my training. After saving the model that I have trained I ran into an obstacle where I can’t run the revised version of the model. That pretty much stops my progression. I tried googling the issue where I was presented with conversations on stack overflow and github. From that I had determined that it was some compatibility issue with the system. I tried to solve the problem by trying different combinations of tensorflow and python but my progress remains in a deadlock. I decided to throw in the towel because I’m getting nowhere and there is little that I can do. Despite ending this project so violently I still think it was a good attempt from me. Spending a year learning something that I like really brings out my interest in computer science. Nevertheless I have no regret in choosing this topic.

### Engineering Design Process
I would say that I was in the process of testing and evaluating my prototype but sadly the progression was halted at that point.

### Knowledge
My knowledge in the process of troubleshooting definitely comes from sites like Stack Overflow and Github. I have been saved by the people who were asking and answering the posts on those sites. Aside from the current problem that I encountered they explained in detail what my problem might be and directed me to a solution.

### Skills
Debugging has been a major part of my project. There comes many times that I need to somehow make my code work despite there being an issue. I find that programmers generally have the more or less the same mindset when creating something universal. From that I relied on my instincts. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t.
<br>
Embracing Failure definitely was tough. The lack of resources on the topic and my limited knowledge drove me to the corner. If I had learned anything from this it would be that I shouldn’t have chosen a project that is so niche. Halite 3 is about 1.5 years old with little people actually posting their project. Although there is a machine learning community for halite but they are more or less experts in their field thus every little explanations.

### Ending
Considering this is the last blog entry I think I should end it with a positive note. Throughout this whole year I have been researching and learning about python. Coding, debugging, and more researching. Without a doubt it was fun. It felt so unconventional since it was so different from your typical melancholy school works. Afterall it is called the “Freedom Project”. If there is anything that stands out from these projects it would probably be individuality.
