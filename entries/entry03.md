### Update
Over the course of a couple weeks, me and my partner are so far on track as to where we should be. To summarize we learned the basic principle of Python, looked into machine learning, and finally tinkered with the base code provided by Halite. In my opinion, learning Python wasn’t much of a problem due to its similarity with Java but more simpler in comparison. Machine learning turn out to be more confusing than we anticipated. Although we are successful in changing up the base code provided by Halite, we are far from understanding the code entirely.<br>
### Engineering Design Process
Since the goal of the project is to understand machine learning by programming a bot on Halite, **researching** would naturally continue to be a part of this process. By consulting various types of sources such as [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp) and [Python’s documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) we will eventually come to an understanding of this topic.<br><br>
In terms of **brainstorming** we are a bit stuck but it should be clear after we research some more about Halite with the help of other people who had done this in the past via Youtube.<br><br>
Although **planning** phrase is a bit far ahead, it really depends on how fast we are able to understand the Halite code.<br>
### Knowledge
There is just too much similarity when it comes to Java and Python so the knowledge I obtain in class can be applicable to Python by default. One good example would be the for-each loop lesson that I learned in Java. If you were to look at the code they are practically the same other than the syntax.<br>
<br>
```Java
    for (String w: words) {
	    w = w.toUppercase();
        System.out.println(w);
    }

```
```Python
    for w in words:
	    w = w.upper()
	    print w

```
### Skills
While looking through the code provide I can see elements of Java in it, however there is plenty that we are not able to understand. This is where **Logical reasoning** comes in as a life saver, I first connect the dots between where the variable is initialized and where it is called to understand how might the program run. Along with the Python comments provided by the person who wrote the code you can get a grip of what you should and should not change.<br>
<br>
**How to learn** is always crucial when it comes to learning a new language in general. In this case, Python is the language I’m learning and it is not particularly hard to learn but it does require you to look up lessons broken into the basic component much like how I learn Java. However we have yet to master the language due to the fact that you can learn a language by just knowing the knowledge but to use it in applications as well.<br>
### Conclusion
So far I have felt that this few weeks in particular there is a lot of researching and LOYO involved, besides that I think there is still so much to learn. In the future, Me and my partner plan to go deeper into machine learning by watching Youtube videos and perhaps online forums to consult problems we are facing.<br>
